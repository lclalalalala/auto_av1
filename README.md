# auto_av1

Tired of your iCloud storage being eaten up by raw videos? This tool automatically transcodes your videos to AV1 format, significantly reducing storage usage while maintaining high quality. With Apple Silicon's native AV1 decoding support, playback is smooth and efficient.

Perfect for running on your NAS as a service - just point it to your video folder and let it handle the rest!

## Why AV1?

- **Better Compression**: AV1 offers superior compression compared to H.264/H.265
- **Native Support**: Apple Silicon Macs support AV1 decoding natively
- **Open and Free**: No licensing fees or patent issues
- **Future Proof**: Growing adoption across platforms and devices

## Features

1. üîç Watches input folder and subfolders for new videos
2. üé¨ Automatically transcodes new videos using av1an
3. üìÅ Flexible output organization - same or different folder
4. üè∑Ô∏è Clear naming with "transcoded" suffix
5. üìù Keeps track of processed files in JSON history
6. üóëÔ∏è Optional cleanup of original files after successful transcoding

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FFmpeg
- av1an

## Quick Start

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto_av1.git
cd auto_av1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install av1an

# Create directories and run
mkdir input output
python src/main.py
```

### Docker Installation (Perfect for NAS)

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto_av1.git
cd auto_av1
docker build -t auto_av1 .

# Run with your folders
docker run -d \
  -v /path/to/videos:/app/input \
  -v /path/to/transcoded:/app/output \
  auto_av1
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize your setup:

```python
# Essential settings
INPUT_FOLDER = "input"              # Where to watch for new videos
OUTPUT_FOLDER = "output"            # Where to save transcoded videos
DELETE_ORIGINAL = False             # Auto-delete originals after transcoding

# AV1 encoding settings
WORKERS = os.cpu_count()            # Use all CPU cores
TARGET_QUALITY = 30                 # Lower = better quality
ENCODER = "aom"                     # Options: aom, rav1e, svt-av1
```

View `config.py` for more advanced settings.

## Usage Tips

1. **For iCloud Users**:
   - Point `INPUT_FOLDER` to your iCloud Photos folder
   - Set `OUTPUT_FOLDER` to a different iCloud folder
   - Enable `DELETE_ORIGINAL` to automatically free up space

2. **For NAS Users**:
   - Use Docker for easy deployment
   - Mount your NAS folders directly
   - Set up as a service for 24/7 operation

3. **Quality vs Size**:
   - Adjust `TARGET_QUALITY` (20-40 range)
   - Lower values = better quality but larger files
   - Default 30 offers good balance

## Monitoring

- View real-time progress in console logs
- Check `transcode_history.json` for processed files
- Monitor output folder for completed transcodes

## Service Management

### Local
```bash
# Start
python src/main.py

# Stop
Ctrl+C
```

### Docker
```bash
# Start
docker run -d auto_av1

# Stop
docker stop <container_id>

# View logs
docker logs <container_id>
```
